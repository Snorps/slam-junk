# Godot Stairs

This is an implementation of stair stepping based on [Shifty's Godot Character Movement Manifesto](https://markdownpastebin.com/?id=d9d61e67f9d64db2bd215f165b931449) and [Collision Response: How to Climb a Staircase Properly](https://thelowrooms.com/articledir/programming_stepclimbing.php).

[TrenchBroom](https://github.com/TrenchBroom/TrenchBroom) and [Qodot](https://github.com/QodotPlugin/Qodot) are used for map building.

[Kenney's Prototype Textures](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/prototype-textures) is used for texturing.

[Garbaj FPS Controller](https://github.com/GarbajYT/godot_updated_fps_controller) is used for basic movement.

Old Godot 3.5+ compatible branch: [3.5](https://github.com/mrezai/GodotStairs/tree/godot-3.5)
